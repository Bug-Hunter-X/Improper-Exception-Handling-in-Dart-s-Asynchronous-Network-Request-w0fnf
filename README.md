# Dart Asynchronous Network Request with Improved Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart code involving asynchronous network requests and JSON parsing, along with a solution that incorporates more robust error handling.

The original `bug.dart` file showcases the issue: generic exception handling that makes it hard to identify the root cause of network errors.  The solution, found in `bugSolution.dart`, demonstrates more precise error handling, including type checking and specific exception messages. This allows developers to quickly diagnose problems and implement appropriate error handling.  Understanding the types of exceptions thrown by libraries is crucial for creating reliable asynchronous operations.
